## 📖 Overview

GameRoulette is a full-stack iOS app that connects to your Steam library and recommends what to play next. Build a personal library, set priorities, mark games complete, and hit the roulette button to get a smart, ranked list of what to play — powered by a content-based filtering algorithm running on a Go backend.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Steam Integration** — Browse and search Steam's full catalog, pull in details, screenshots, genres, and descriptions
- 📚 **Personal Library** — Add games, set priority (High / Medium / Low), and mark them complete
- 🤖 **Smart Recommendations** — Content-based filtering using TF-IDF weighted cosine similarity + Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to surface relevant *and* diverse picks
- 🎲 **Roulette Mode** — Get 5 ranked recommendations from your library; falls back to Steam catalog for new users
- 🎨 **Theming** — Customizable UI themes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode (latest stable)
- Go 1.22+
- A [Steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
- A Firebase project with Firestore enabled and a service account JSON key

### Backend (local)

```bash
cd backend

export STEAM_API_KEY="your_steam_api_key"
export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS='{ ...your service account JSON... }'

go run .
# Server starts on :8080
```

### Backend (Docker)

Create `backend/.env` (gitignored):
```env
STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS={ ...your service account JSON... }
```

Then:
```bash
cd backend
docker compose up --build
# Server starts on :8080
```

### iOS App

1. Open `GameRoulette.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` (Firebase config) to the `GameRoulette/` folder — this file is gitignored
3. *(Optional)* Create `GameRoulette/Secrets.swift` to pre-fill your Steam ID at build time:
   ```swift
   enum Secrets {
       static var steamID = "your_steam_id"
   }
   ```
   If this file is absent, the app's Welcome screen will prompt you to enter your Steam ID manually on first launch — no file required.
4. In `BackendService.swift`, set the production URL for Release builds
5. Select a simulator or device and press `Cmd+R`

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/steam/apps` | Proxy — full Steam game catalog |
| `GET` | `/steam/appdetails?appids=<id>` | Proxy — game details from Steam Store |
| `GET` | `/steam/mygames?steamID=<id>` | Proxy — games owned by a Steam user |
| `GET` | `/library?userID=<id>` | Fetch user's saved library |
| `POST` | `/library?userID=<id>` | Add a game to the library |
| `DELETE` | `/library/{gameID}?userID=<id>` | Remove a game |
| `PATCH` | `/library/{gameID}?userID=<id>` | Update game priority |
| `GET` | `/recommend?userID=<id>` | Get top 5 recommended games |

## 🤖 Recommendation Algorithm

The `/recommend` endpoint runs a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Cold start guard** — if fewer than 3 non-complete games exist, returns them sorted by priority (no scoring)
2. **TF-IDF scoring** — genres are weighted by how distinctive they are in the user's library (rare genres the user specifically collected score higher than generic ones like "Indie" or "Action")
3. **MMR selection** — instead of returning the top 5 scores directly, Maximal Marginal Relevance iteratively picks games that balance relevance (λ=0.7) against redundancy with already-selected games, ensuring genre diversity in results

Games marked **Complete** are excluded from recommendations unless the entire library is complete, in which case they are used as the candidate pool.
